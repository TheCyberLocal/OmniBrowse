# OmniBrowser
## The browser that searches all browser engines for the best results.

OmniBrowser is a web application designed to browse multiple search engines simultaneously with ease. The application allows you to search once and view the results from different search engines in dedicated tabs.

## Purpose

The purpose of OmniBrowser is to provide a seamless browsing experience across multiple search engines, allowing users to quickly compare results and navigate through different engines without losing their place.

## Features
